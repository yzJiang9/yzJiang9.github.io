It is the best of times, and it is the worst of times. Au revoir! 

Here are some excerpts from the acknowledgements in my thesis.

<blockquote style="text-align: justify; font-size: 16px;">
Lastly, but certainly not least, I extend my heartfelt thanks to some of my closest friends - Yumeng Zhang, Weiyi Li, Yufan Xu, and Yuchen Fang. Your constant companionship since our junior year has been invaluable. We have shared joy and sorrow in equal measure, and our bond has grown deeper than mere friendship. Now, as we stand at life's crossroads, I am confident that these cherished memories will linger long in our hearts. Parting ways doesn't necessarily signify an end; instead, it marks the beginning of new journeys in our lives. As you set forth on your individual paths, I wish you safe travels and all the success that life has to offer. I eagerly anticipate the day of our reunion. Once again, thank you for bringing vibrancy and joy into my life, for making it anything but mundane.

- How should we say goodbye? <br />
- As we said hello.
