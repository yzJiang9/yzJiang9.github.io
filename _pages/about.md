Greetings! I am a Ph.D. student in the Program of Computational Biology and Bioinformatics ([CB&B](https://cbb.yale.edu/)) at Yale.

I am supervised by [Mark B. Gertsein](http://www.gersteinlab.org/), the Albert L. Williams Professor of Biomedical Informatics. I have a broad interest in functional genomics, particularly understanding the roles of non-coding regions in the human genome using multi-omics data.

Prior to embarking on the exciting journey at Yale, I graduated with distinction from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), where I majored in Bioinformatics and Biostatistics. Guided by Professor [Chaochun Wei](https://cgm.sjtu.edu.cn/), my undergraduate thesis concentrated on investigating horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events within the rice pan-genome. 

I also worked as a research assistant in the [Scott Lab](https://lab.research.sickkids.ca/scott/) at the University of Toronto in 2018, focusing on the early cardiac lineage specification in zebrafish.
