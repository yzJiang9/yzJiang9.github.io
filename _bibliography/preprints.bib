	abstract = {The majority of mammalian genes encode multiple transcript isoforms that result from differential promoter use, changes in exonic splicing, and alternative 3{\textquoteright} end choice. Detecting and quantifying transcript isoforms across tissues, cell types, and species has been extremely challenging because transcripts are much longer than the short reads normally used for RNA-seq. By contrast, long-read RNA-seq (LR-RNA-seq) gives the complete structure of most transcripts. We sequenced 264 LR-RNA-seq PacBio libraries totaling over 1 billion circular consensus reads (CCS) for 81 unique human and mouse samples. We detect at least one full-length transcript from 87.7\% of annotated human protein coding genes and a total of 200,000 full-length transcripts, 40\% of which have novel exon junction chains.To capture and compute on the three sources of transcript structure diversity, we introduce a gene and transcript annotation framework that uses triplets representing the transcript start site, exon junction chain, and transcript end site of each transcript. Using triplets in a simplex representation demonstrates how promoter selection, splice pattern, and 3{\textquoteright} processing are deployed across human tissues, with nearly half of multitranscript protein coding genes showing a clear bias toward one of the three diversity mechanisms. Evaluated across samples, the predominantly expressed transcript changes for 74\% of protein coding genes. In evolution, the human and mouse transcriptomes are globally similar in types of transcript structure diversity, yet among individual orthologous gene pairs, more than half (57.8\%) show substantial differences in mechanism of diversification in matching tissues. This initial large-scale survey of human and mouse long-read transcriptomes provides a foundation for further analyses of alternative transcript usage, and is complemented by short-read and microRNA data on the same samples and by epigenome data elsewhere in the ENCODE4 collection.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Understanding the mechanisms of T-cell antigen recognition that underpin adaptive immune responses is critical for the development of vaccines, immunotherapies, and treatments against autoimmune diseases. Despite extensive research efforts, the accurate identification of T cell receptor (TCR)-antigen binding pairs remains a significant challenge due to the vast diversity and cross-reactivity of TCRs. Here, we propose a deep-learning framework termed Epitope-anchored Contrastive Transfer Learning (EPACT) tailored to paired human CD8+ TCRs from single-cell sequencing data. Harnessing the pre-trained representations and the contrastive co-embedding space, EPACT demonstrates state-of-the-art model generalizability in predicting TCR binding specificity for unseen epitopes and distinct TCR repertoires, offering potential values for practical outcomes in real-world scenarios. The contrastive learning paradigm achieves highly precise predictions for immunodominant epitopes and facilitates interpretable analysis of epitope-specific T cells. The TCR binding strength predicted by EPACT aligns well with the surge in spike-specific immune responses targeting SARS-CoV-2 epitopes after vaccination. We further fine-tune EPACT on TCR-epitope structural data to decipher the residue-level interactions involved in T-cell antigen recognition. EPACT not only exhibits superior capabilities in quantifying inter-chain distance matrices and identifying contact residue pairs but also corroborates the presence of molecular mimicry across multiple tumor-associated antigens. Together, EPACT can serve as a useful AI approach with significant potential in practical applications and contribute toward the development of TCR-based diagnostics and immunotherapies.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
