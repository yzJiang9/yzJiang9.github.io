	abstract = {The majority of mammalian genes encode multiple transcript isoforms that result from differential promoter use, changes in exonic splicing, and alternative 3{\textquoteright} end choice. Detecting and quantifying transcript isoforms across tissues, cell types, and species has been extremely challenging because transcripts are much longer than the short reads normally used for RNA-seq. By contrast, long-read RNA-seq (LR-RNA-seq) gives the complete structure of most transcripts. We sequenced 264 LR-RNA-seq PacBio libraries totaling over 1 billion circular consensus reads (CCS) for 81 unique human and mouse samples. We detect at least one full-length transcript from 87.7\% of annotated human protein coding genes and a total of 200,000 full-length transcripts, 40\% of which have novel exon junction chains.To capture and compute on the three sources of transcript structure diversity, we introduce a gene and transcript annotation framework that uses triplets representing the transcript start site, exon junction chain, and transcript end site of each transcript. Using triplets in a simplex representation demonstrates how promoter selection, splice pattern, and 3{\textquoteright} processing are deployed across human tissues, with nearly half of multitranscript protein coding genes showing a clear bias toward one of the three diversity mechanisms. Evaluated across samples, the predominantly expressed transcript changes for 74\% of protein coding genes. In evolution, the human and mouse transcriptomes are globally similar in types of transcript structure diversity, yet among individual orthologous gene pairs, more than half (57.8\%) show substantial differences in mechanism of diversification in matching tissues. This initial large-scale survey of human and mouse long-read transcriptomes provides a foundation for further analyses of alternative transcript usage, and is complemented by short-read and microRNA data on the same samples and by epigenome data elsewhere in the ENCODE4 collection.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Non-canonical (i.e., unannotated) open reading frames (ncORFs) have until recently been omitted from reference genome annotations, despite evidence of their translation, limiting their incorporation into biomedical research. To address this, in 2022, we initiated the TransCODE consortium and built the first community-driven consensus catalog of human ncORFs, which was openly distributed to the research community via Ensembl-GENCODE. While this catalog represented a starting point for reference ncORF annotation, major technical and scientific issues remained. In particular, this initial catalogue had no standardized framework to judge the evidence of translation for individual ncORFs. Here, we present an expanded and refined catalog of the human reference annotation of ncORFs. By incorporating more datasets and by lifting constraints on ORF length and start-codon, we define a comprehensive set of 28,359 ncORFs that is nearly four times the size of the previous catalog. Furthermore, to aid users who wish to work with ncORFs with the strongest and most reproducible signals of translation, we utilized a data-driven framework (i.e. translation signature scores) to assess the accumulated evidence for any individual ncORF. Using this approach, we derive a subset of 7,888 ncORFs with translation evidence on par with canonical protein-coding genes, which we refer to as the Primary set. This set can serve as a reliable reference for downstream analyses and validation, with a particular emphasis on high quality. Overall, this update reflects continual community-driven efforts to make ncORFs accessible and actionable to the broader research public and further iterations of the catalog will continue to expand and refine this resource.Competing Interest StatementJ.R.P. has received research honoraria from Novartis Biosciences and Quantum-Si, and is a paid consultant for ProFound Therapeutics.

	abstract = {HIV infection exerts profound and long-lasting neurodegenerative effects on the central nervous system (CNS) that can persist despite antiretroviral therapy (ART). Here, we used single-nucleus multiome sequencing to map the transcriptomic and epigenetic landscapes of postmortem human brains from 13 healthy individuals and 20 individuals with HIV who have a history of treatment with ART. Our study spanned three distinct regions{\textemdash}the prefrontal cortex, insular cortex, and ventral striatum{\textemdash}enabling a comprehensive exploration of region-specific and cross-regional perturbations. We found widespread and persistent HIV-associated transcriptional and epigenetic alterations across multiple cell types. Detailed analyses of microglia revealed state changes marked by immune activation and metabolic dysregulation, while integrative multiomic profiling of astrocytes identified multiple subpopulations, including a reactive subpopulation unique to HIV-infected brains. These findings suggest that cells from people with HIV exhibit molecular shifts that may underlie ongoing neuroinflammation and CNS dysfunction. Furthermore, cell{\textendash}cell communication analyses uncovered dysregulated and pro-inflammatory interactions among glial populations, underscoring the multifaceted and enduring impact of HIV on the brain milieu. Collectively, our comprehensive atlas of HIV-associated brain changes reveals distinct glial cell states with signatures of pro-inflammatory signaling and metabolic dysregulation, providing a framework for developing targeted therapies for HIV-associated neurological dysfunction.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
