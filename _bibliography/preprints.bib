	abstract = {The majority of mammalian genes encode multiple transcript isoforms that result from differential promoter use, changes in exonic splicing, and alternative 3{\textquoteright} end choice. Detecting and quantifying transcript isoforms across tissues, cell types, and species has been extremely challenging because transcripts are much longer than the short reads normally used for RNA-seq. By contrast, long-read RNA-seq (LR-RNA-seq) gives the complete structure of most transcripts. We sequenced 264 LR-RNA-seq PacBio libraries totaling over 1 billion circular consensus reads (CCS) for 81 unique human and mouse samples. We detect at least one full-length transcript from 87.7\% of annotated human protein coding genes and a total of 200,000 full-length transcripts, 40\% of which have novel exon junction chains.To capture and compute on the three sources of transcript structure diversity, we introduce a gene and transcript annotation framework that uses triplets representing the transcript start site, exon junction chain, and transcript end site of each transcript. Using triplets in a simplex representation demonstrates how promoter selection, splice pattern, and 3{\textquoteright} processing are deployed across human tissues, with nearly half of multitranscript protein coding genes showing a clear bias toward one of the three diversity mechanisms. Evaluated across samples, the predominantly expressed transcript changes for 74\% of protein coding genes. In evolution, the human and mouse transcriptomes are globally similar in types of transcript structure diversity, yet among individual orthologous gene pairs, more than half (57.8\%) show substantial differences in mechanism of diversification in matching tissues. This initial large-scale survey of human and mouse long-read transcriptomes provides a foundation for further analyses of alternative transcript usage, and is complemented by short-read and microRNA data on the same samples and by epigenome data elsewhere in the ENCODE4 collection.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Diverse sets of complete human genomes are required to construct a pangenome reference and to understand the extent of complex structural variation. Here, we sequence 65 diverse human genomes and build 130 haplotype-resolved assemblies (130 Mbp median continuity), closing 92\% of all previous assembly gaps1,2 and reaching telomere-to-telomere (T2T) status for 39\% of the chromosomes. We highlight complete sequence continuity of complex loci, including the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), SMN1/SMN2, NBPF8, and AMY1/AMY2, and fully resolve 1,852 complex structural variants (SVs). In addition, we completely assemble and validate 1,246 human centromeres. We find up to 30-fold variation in α-satellite high-order repeat (HOR) array length and characterize the pattern of mobile element insertions into α-satellite HOR arrays. While most centromeres predict a single site of kinetochore attachment, epigenetic analysis suggests the presence of two hypomethylated regions for 7\% of centromeres. Combining our data with the draft pangenome reference1 significantly enhances genotyping accuracy from short-read data, enabling whole-genome inference3 to a median quality value (QV) of 45. Using this approach, 26,115 SVs per sample are detected, substantially increasing the number of SVs now amenable to downstream disease association studies.},
