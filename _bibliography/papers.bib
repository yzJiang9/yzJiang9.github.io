    abstract = {GENCODE produces comprehensive reference gene annotation for human and mouse. Entering its twentieth year, the project remains highly active as new technologies and methodologies allow us to catalog the genome at ever-increasing granularity. In particular, long-read transcriptome sequencing enables us to identify large numbers of missing transcripts and to substantially improve existing models, and our long non-coding RNA catalogs have undergone a dramatic expansion and reconfiguration as a result. Meanwhile, we are incorporating data from state-of-the-art proteomics and Ribo-seq experiments to fine-tune our annotation of translated sequences, while further insights into function can be gained from multi-genome alignments that grow richer as more species’ genomes are sequenced. Such methodologies are combined into a fully integrated annotation workflow. However, the increasing complexity of our resources can present usability challenges, and we are resolving these with the creation of filtered genesets such as MANE Select and GENCODE Primary. The next challenge is to propagate annotations throughout multiple human and mouse genomes, as we enter the pangenome era. Our resources are freely available at our web portal www.gencodegenes.org, and via the Ensembl and UCSC genome browsers.},

  abstract = {Understanding the mechanisms of T cell antigen recognition that underpin adaptive immune responses is critical for developing vaccines, immunotherapies and treatments against autoimmune diseases. Despite extensive research efforts, accurate prediction of T cell receptor (TCR)–antigen binding pairs remains a great challenge due to the vast diversity and cross-reactivity of TCRs. Here we propose a deep-learning-based framework termed epitope-anchored contrastive transfer learning (EPACT) tailored to paired human CD8+ TCRs. Harnessing the pretrained representations and co-embeddings of peptide–major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) and TCR, EPACT demonstrated generalizability in predicting binding specificity for unseen epitopes and distinct TCR repertoires. Contrastive learning enabled highly precise predictions for immunodominant epitopes and interpretable analysis of epitope-specific T cells. We applied EPACT to SARS-CoV-2-responsive T cells, and the predicted binding strength aligned well with the surge in spike-specific immune responses after vaccination. We further fine-tuned EPACT on structural data to decipher the residue-level interactions involved in TCR–antigen recognition. EPACT was capable of quantifying interchain distance matrices and identifying contact residues, corroborating the presence of TCR cross-reactivity across multiple tumour-associated antigens. Together, EPACT can serve as a useful artificial intelligence approach with important potential in practical applications and contribute towards the development of TCR-based immunotherapies.},

abstract = {Single-cell genomics is a powerful tool for studying heterogeneous tissues such as the brain. Yet little is understood about how genetic variants influence cell-level gene expression. Addressing this, we uniformly processed single-nuclei, multiomics datasets into a resource comprising \&gt;2.8 million nuclei from the prefrontal cortex across 388 individuals. For 28 cell types, we assessed population-level variation in expression and chromatin across gene families and drug targets. We identified \&gt;550,000 cell type–specific regulatory elements and \&gt;1.4 million single-cell expression quantitative trait loci, which we used to build cell-type regulatory and cell-to-cell communication networks. These networks manifest cellular changes in aging and neuropsychiatric disorders. We further constructed an integrative model accurately imputing single-cell expression and simulating perturbations; the model prioritized ~250 disease-risk genes and drug targets with associated cell types.}

Here, we present an update on the annotation of human and mouse genes, including developments in the tools, data, analyses and major collaborations which underpin this progress. For example, we report the creation of a set of non-canonical ORFs identified in GENCODE transcripts, the LRGASP collaboration to assess the use of long transcriptomic data to build transcript models, the progress in collaborations with RefSeq and UniProt to increase convergence in the annotation of human and mouse protein-coding genes, the propagation of GENCODE across the human pan-genome and the development of new tools to support annotation of regulatory features by GENCODE.

abstract = {Understanding how genetic variants impact molecular phenotypes is a key goal of functional genomics, currently hindered by reliance on a single haploid reference genome. Here, we present the EN-TEx resource of 1,635 open-access datasets from four donors (∼30 tissues × ∼15 assays). The datasets are mapped to matched, diploid genomes with long-read phasing and structural variants, instantiating a catalog of >1 million allele-specific loci. These loci exhibit coordinated activity along haplotypes and are less conserved than corresponding, non-allele-specific ones. Surprisingly, a deep-learning transformer model can predict the allele-specific activity based only on local nucleotide-sequence context, highlighting the importance of transcription-factor-binding motifs particularly sensitive to variants. Furthermore, combining EN-TEx with existing genome annotations reveals strong associations between allele-specific and GWAS loci. It also enables models for transferring known eQTLs to difficult-to-profile tissues (e.g., from skin to heart). Overall, EN-TEx provides rich data and generalizable models for more accurate personal functional genomics.},
