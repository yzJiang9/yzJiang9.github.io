	abstract = {Many human diseases are the result of early developmental defects. As most paediatric diseases and disorders are rare, children are critically underrepresented in research. Functional genomics studies primarily rely on adult tissues and lack critical cell states in specific developmental windows. In parallel, little is known about the conservation of developmental programmes across non-human primate (NHP) species, with implications for human evolution. Here we introduce the developmental Genotype-Tissue Expression (dGTEx) projects, which span humans and NHPs and aim to integrate gene expression, regulation and genetics data across development and species. The dGTEx cohort will consist of 74 tissue sites across 120 human donors from birth to adulthood, and developmentally matched NHP age groups, with additional prenatal and adult animals, with 126 rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) and 72 common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus). The data will comprise whole-genome sequencing, extensive bulk, single-cell and spatial gene expression profiles, and chromatin accessibility data across tissues and development. Through community engagement and donor diversity, the human dGTEx study seeks to address disparities in genomic research. Thus, dGTEx will provide a reference human and NHP dataset and tissue bank, enabling research into developmental changes in expression and gene regulation, childhood disorders and the effect of genetic variation on development.},

	abstract = {Diverse sets of complete human genomes are required to construct a pangenome reference and to understand the extent of complex structural variation. Here we sequence 65 diverse human genomes and build 130 haplotype-resolved assemblies (median continuity of 130 Mb), closing 92\% of all previous assembly gaps1,2 and reaching telomere-to-telomere status for 39\% of the chromosomes. We highlight complete sequence continuity of complex loci, including the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), SMN1/SMN2, NBPF8 and AMY1/AMY2, and fully resolve 1,852 complex structural variants. In addition, we completely assemble and validate 1,246 human centromeres. We find up to 30-fold variation in α-satellite higher-order repeat array length and characterize the pattern of mobile element insertions into α-satellite higher-order repeat arrays. Although most centromeres predict a single site of kinetochore attachment, epigenetic analysis suggests the presence of two hypomethylated regions for 7\% of centromeres. Combining our data with the draft pangenome reference1 significantly enhances genotyping accuracy from short-read data, enabling whole-genome inference3 to a median quality value of 45. Using this approach, 26,115 structural variants per individual are detected, substantially increasing the number of structural variants now amenable to downstream disease association studies.},

    abstract = {GENCODE produces comprehensive reference gene annotation for human and mouse. Entering its twentieth year, the project remains highly active as new technologies and methodologies allow us to catalog the genome at ever-increasing granularity. In particular, long-read transcriptome sequencing enables us to identify large numbers of missing transcripts and to substantially improve existing models, and our long non-coding RNA catalogs have undergone a dramatic expansion and reconfiguration as a result. Meanwhile, we are incorporating data from state-of-the-art proteomics and Ribo-seq experiments to fine-tune our annotation of translated sequences, while further insights into function can be gained from multi-genome alignments that grow richer as more species’ genomes are sequenced. Such methodologies are combined into a fully integrated annotation workflow. However, the increasing complexity of our resources can present usability challenges, and we are resolving these with the creation of filtered genesets such as MANE Select and GENCODE Primary. The next challenge is to propagate annotations throughout multiple human and mouse genomes, as we enter the pangenome era. Our resources are freely available at our web portal www.gencodegenes.org, and via the Ensembl and UCSC genome browsers.},

  abstract = {Understanding the mechanisms of T cell antigen recognition that underpin adaptive immune responses is critical for developing vaccines, immunotherapies and treatments against autoimmune diseases. Despite extensive research efforts, accurate prediction of T cell receptor (TCR)–antigen binding pairs remains a great challenge due to the vast diversity and cross-reactivity of TCRs. Here we propose a deep-learning-based framework termed epitope-anchored contrastive transfer learning (EPACT) tailored to paired human CD8+ TCRs. Harnessing the pretrained representations and co-embeddings of peptide–major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) and TCR, EPACT demonstrated generalizability in predicting binding specificity for unseen epitopes and distinct TCR repertoires. Contrastive learning enabled highly precise predictions for immunodominant epitopes and interpretable analysis of epitope-specific T cells. We applied EPACT to SARS-CoV-2-responsive T cells, and the predicted binding strength aligned well with the surge in spike-specific immune responses after vaccination. We further fine-tuned EPACT on structural data to decipher the residue-level interactions involved in TCR–antigen recognition. EPACT was capable of quantifying interchain distance matrices and identifying contact residues, corroborating the presence of TCR cross-reactivity across multiple tumour-associated antigens. Together, EPACT can serve as a useful artificial intelligence approach with important potential in practical applications and contribute towards the development of TCR-based immunotherapies.},

    abstract = {Single-cell genomics is a powerful tool for studying heterogeneous tissues such as the brain. Yet little is understood about how genetic variants influence cell-level gene expression. Addressing this, we uniformly processed single-nuclei, multiomics datasets into a resource comprising \&gt;2.8 million nuclei from the prefrontal cortex across 388 individuals. For 28 cell types, we assessed population-level variation in expression and chromatin across gene families and drug targets. We identified \&gt;550,000 cell type–specific regulatory elements and \&gt;1.4 million single-cell expression quantitative trait loci, which we used to build cell-type regulatory and cell-to-cell communication networks. These networks manifest cellular changes in aging and neuropsychiatric disorders. We further constructed an integrative model accurately imputing single-cell expression and simulating perturbations; the model prioritized ~250 disease-risk genes and drug targets with associated cell types.}

    abstract = {Understanding how genetic variants impact molecular phenotypes is a key goal of functional genomics, currently hindered by reliance on a single haploid reference genome. Here, we present the EN-TEx resource of 1,635 open-access datasets from four donors (∼30 tissues × ∼15 assays). The datasets are mapped to matched, diploid genomes with long-read phasing and structural variants, instantiating a catalog of >1 million allele-specific loci. These loci exhibit coordinated activity along haplotypes and are less conserved than corresponding, non-allele-specific ones. Surprisingly, a deep-learning transformer model can predict the allele-specific activity based only on local nucleotide-sequence context, highlighting the importance of transcription-factor-binding motifs particularly sensitive to variants. Furthermore, combining EN-TEx with existing genome annotations reveals strong associations between allele-specific and GWAS loci. It also enables models for transferring known eQTLs to difficult-to-profile tissues (e.g., from skin to heart). Overall, EN-TEx provides rich data and generalizable models for more accurate personal functional genomics.},
